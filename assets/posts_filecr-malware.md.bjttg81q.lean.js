Because the malware is included in multiple unrelated cracks and because they have not responded at all to reports, they are likely to be in some way involved in spreading or creating the malware. Also, some of the malware had descriptions written just for FileCR, which is unusual, and the description for KMS matrix contains lies about the activation given by the software.</p><h2 id="samples" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://rentry.co/big_load_malware#samples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Samples</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#samples" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Samples](https://rentry.co/big_load_malware#samples)&quot;">​</a></h2><h2 id="am-i-infected" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://rentry.co/big_load_malware#am-i-infected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Am I infected?</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#am-i-infected" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Am I infected?](https://rentry.co/big_load_malware#am-i-infected)&quot;">​</a></h2>',8))])}const b=r(n,[["render",c]]);export{u as __pageData,b as default};
