As we bid farewell to &#39;23, let&#39;s take a moment to reflect on the remarkable journey Lost Pages has had this year:</p><ul><li>We made a new website, enriched with an array of handcrafted features (by me, of course) to enhance your experience and make browsing the wiki pleasant on all devices (mobile included!)</li><li>We opened our Discord server and reached 10k members, which introduced many new great people to this community and made contribution easy</li><li>We&#39;ve reached 250k+ members and 31 million views on reddit!</li><li>Our Lost Pagesedit repository oversaw an impressive 1k+ pull requests made by the community and merged over 8k commits!</li><li>This wiki has grown to be more than just a piracy index, so we felt it&#39;s about time other sections get some love. As such, we organized and separated tools sections into their own pages, which allowed us to move a lot of useful tools out of storage and make it a lot easier to discover them</li><li>We started the debloat arc of Lost Pages and went from 27k links to 24k! We&#39;ve removed a lot of dead, useless, and niche links / categories, as well as re-organized a lot of sections for better clarity and easier navigation</li></ul><p>As we enter 2024, we eagerly anticipate building on our achievements and evolving together. Lost Pages wouldn&#39;t be what it is today without the love and support of everyone in this community. Thank you for being an integral part of Lost Pages. Here&#39;s to another year of growth and success! üíô</p><h3 id="wiki-updates" tabindex="-1">Wiki Updates <a class="header-anchor" href="#wiki-updates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Wiki Updates&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li><p>Made our own instances for both <strong><a href="https://searx.Lost Pages.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SearX</a></strong> + <strong><a href="https://whoogle.Lost Pages.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Whoogle</a></strong>.</p></li><li><p>Made a <a href="/posts">Posts</a> page on our site, so you can see all updates without needing reddit.
